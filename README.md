<b> About </b>

The game has a target score the user is trying to reach. The user will be able to select out of four crystals which all have a different value. If user hits the target score they get a win, if the user goes over, then they lose. Each game will reset the values of the crystals to make the game more challenging. 

<b> Functionality </b>

* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. 
* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. 
* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. 
* The player loses if their score goes above the random number. 
* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. 
* The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
